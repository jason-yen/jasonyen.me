                I will tell you my history. I was just a normal kid when I saw my friend and classmate in 2nd grade. I
                was in
                IVA
                and in the hard times of corona virus. I saw that my classmate codes, and I wanted to code too! I asked
                my dad
                to help and teach me to code, and he
                said yes! I was so happy on my first day. I even code almost all day now! I am grateful my dad taught me
                to
                code. I loved to code and learn how to code. I am still learning to code even now! My favorite game is
                chess.
                My favorite color is light blue. (Extra! My favorite side color is normal green.) I like play when I am
                not
                coding. Games like snake, chess, parachute, and sometimes games with my on MacBook Pro! I like to play
                some
                games like video games too! I like to play racing with my baby brother. I code only when I can. One
                thing I
                really like is to invent. What do I invent? I love inventing anything you can imagine, from rock
                bulldozers
                to snow machines, superheros to robots! I also like the movie tranfomers! </div>
